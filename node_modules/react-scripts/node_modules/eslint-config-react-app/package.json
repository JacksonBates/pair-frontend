  "readme": "# eslint-config-react-app\n\nThis package includes the shareable ESLint configuration used by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).  \nPlease refer to its documentation:\n\n* [Getting Started](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) – How to create a new app.\n* [User Guide](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.\n\n## Usage in Create React App Projects\n\nThe easiest way to use this configuration is with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Create React App projects.**\n\n## Usage Outside of Create React App\n\nIf you want to use this ESLint configuration in a project not built with Create React App, you can install it with following steps.\n\nFirst, install this package, ESLint and the necessary plugins.\n\n  ```sh\n  npm install --save-dev eslint-config-react-app babel-eslint@7.0.0 eslint@3.8.1 eslint-plugin-flowtype@2.21.0 eslint-plugin-import@2.0.1 eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y@2.2.3 eslint-plugin-react@6.4.1\n  ```\n\nThen create a file named `.eslintrc` with following contents in the root folder of your project:\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    \"extends\": \"react-app\"\n  }\n  ```\n\n  That's it! You can override the settings from `eslint-config-react-app` by editing the `.eslintrc` file. Learn more about [configuring ESLint](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring) on the ESLint website.\n",
