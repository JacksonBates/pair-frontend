* [MarcoThePoro](https://github.com/MarcoThePoro) :) Did all the exercises in front-end but can't get myself to stick to the projects. I'm from Melbourne. I've made a few PRs to a little atom plugin called less-than-slash. I want to add simple hash routing so the url reflects which modals are open.

* [NathanGell](https://github.com/NathanGell) Hey everyone! I'm from Melbourne. I have been working through the FCC curriculum for a while now. Learning React at the moment. I'm also experimenting with the Web Audio API. I'd like to integrate a messaging system to connect the pairers. I'm keen to start contributing to some open source projects and this looks like the perfect one to pop my cherry!!
